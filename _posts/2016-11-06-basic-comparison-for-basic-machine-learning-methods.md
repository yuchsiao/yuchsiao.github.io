## Logistic Regression


## SVM


## Decision Trees

### Random Forest

### Gradient Boost Tree

## Deep Learning



# Off topic below

## Deep learning development

### Supervised learning

+ Better initialization: introduced in 2010
+ ReLu: introduced in 2011
+ Dropout: a better regularizer in 2014
+ RNN cannot remember things for more than a couple of steps long back then.
+ Momentum
+ Dropcoeonnect
+ Maxout

### Unsupervised learning

+ Pure unsupervised learning
+ Transfer learning 
+ Semi-supervised learning 
+ Domain adaptation
+ Self-taught learning

## ML in late 90's 

+ SVM and convex optimization
+ L1 regularization and sparsity
+ Automated feature detecteion like NMF

## ML in 2000's

+ All learning is non-convex.
